This is a component library I am building over time which includes multiple website components. Much like if you were to use a website builder you can just mix and match between different pieces to create a unique website.

Each component is responsive, and everything is functional. Forms are controlled with react-hook-form and zod and everything is typesafe.

All colors can be changed by adding a value passed as a prop (ie. <FooterOne color="#F5F5F5" />). The default colors are tied to your default tailwind config.
